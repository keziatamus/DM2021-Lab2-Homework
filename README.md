Homework 2 for ISA5810

The homework for Lab Assignment 2 can be found in DM2021-Lab2-Homework.ipynb and Sentiment-Analysis.ipynb file. 
This first file includes the take-home exercises and the second file includes the code for Kaggle Competition. It also includes preprocessing steps, the feature engineering steps and an explanation of my model.
However, the output of the code can't be shown since I was working on Kaggle and it doesn't let me save my notebook because of the insufficient memory size. Therefore, I screencaptured some visualizations instead.
